The Maze project 
The goal of this project is to create a game in 3D using raycasting !

Template for Maze Project

 1. Challenges:
    Some of the challenges that I might face when doing the maze project :
    Managing memory and pointer usage.
    Writing efficient and robust code to ensure the maze project runs correctly and efficiently.
    Debugging the code and finding errors in the code.
    Writing code that can handle different types of input data.
    Testing and verifying the code for accuracy and completeness.

  2.  Collaboration/Communication:

    Establish clear roles and responsibilities for each team member
    Define a communication plan and schedule
    Set up a meeting or online workspace for collaboration

    3. Project Updates:

    Document project progress and accomplishments
    Schedule regular meetings to review progress and discuss issues
    Set up an online system for tracking project tasks and milestones.

Progress:
One the scale of 1-10 I rate my progress as 7.
I'm measuring this based on readiness.
Because I'm set for the project only few limitations.
Will be putting effort to complete the project in the minimum possible time.
			MVP (Minimum Viable Product) proposal

1. Walls: Create a 2D array to represent the maze and draw walls using SDL2 graphics library. The walls should be represented by rectangles or lines.
 
2. Orientation: Use the arrow keys to control the movement and rotation of the player in the maze. You can use SDL_Event to handle user input.
 
3. Move: Implement basic movement logic for the player. Allow the player to move forward, backward, left, and right in the maze.


4. Ouch: Add collision detection between the player and the walls. The player should not be able to move through the walls. If the player collides with a wall, stop the player's movement. 


5. Parser: Create a simple parser to read the maze data from a text file and store it in a 2D array.
 
6. Draw the Map: Draw the maze using the maze data stored in the 2D array. You can use different colors for the walls and ground/ceiling to make them visually distinct.
 
7. Textures: Add basic textures to the walls using SDL2's texture rendering functions.
